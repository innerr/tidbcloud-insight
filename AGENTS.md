# Cmd args and env
- Read ticat repo to understand env
- All args of all cmds should map to env, and cmds can read values from env
- All default values of args should be written to EnvLayer3rdDefault
- Only for this repo: time-range args (4 of them) should be at the end of all args when registering the cmd
